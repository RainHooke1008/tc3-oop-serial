## Overview 
It is sometimes a requirement to interface with equipment via a serial port.  Handling RS232 (or any other text based commands) can become a problem to implement if the equipment has a high number of commands, responses which are custom to the sent command, or multiple versions of a command set. 

This can all be simplified by implementing the command pattern in OOP which is shown in this project

## TwinCAT
This project uses TcXaeShell 3.1.4024.15

## Getting started
This is not a guide for TcXaeShell, please visit http://beckhoff.com/ for further guides
* This is for demo only and will need further hardware in order to run the code.
